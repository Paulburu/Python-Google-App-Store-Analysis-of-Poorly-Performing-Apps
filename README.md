# Python-Google-App-Store-Analysis-of-Poorly-Performing-Apps

In this project I tried to explain why apps found on the google app store are performing poorly. The main metric analyzed were the reviews. In order to quantify a review i used a sentimental 
analysis that allowed me to quantify negativity or positivity of a review and therefore check if it affects the app score.
