# Python-Google-App-Store-Analysis-of-Poorly-Performing-Apps

In this project I tried to explain why apps found on the google app store are performing poorly. The main features analyzed were the reviews and app score. In order to quantify a review I used sentimental 
analysis that allowed me to find the negativity or positivity of a review and therefore check if and how much it affects the app score.
